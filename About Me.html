<body>
    <h1>Shonibare Qudrah Afolake</h1>
    <p>I live at number 2, Olatuja street, Adaloko, Ijanikin Ojo, Lagos State.<br>
        I love reading for fun and acquiring beneficial knowledge, travelling and sight seeing and most beloved hobby is meditating about the wonders of creations.
    </p>
   <h2>More About Me</h2>
  <p>I <b>love</b> being in the midst of those that can help my growth positively, be it spiritually, academically, pscycologically and any other means of becoming a better <b>Muslimah</b> day by day.</p> 
   <p>I also<i>love to be friend</i> with people that are striving to be better and are ahead of me spiritually. morally and intellectually.I <strong>admire and respect people</strong>  that help people get to be a better version of themselves <b>a lot</b>,</p>
<h3>Submission And Conclusion</h3>
<p>Let us be prayerful, for ourselves and the Muslim Ummah. We can only be victorious when we go back to the way we've been taught by the <b>One</b> sent to us from our Creator. The victory is near only if we are ready to abide by the pristine way of Islam. <b>Remember our brothers and sisters</b> around the <i>WORLD</i> in your prayers <strong>ALWAYS</strong> especially those in <b><i>Palestine, Syria, Yemen, Sudan and all other places </i></b> Muslims are being victimized. May Allah in His infinite mercy aanswer all our prayers.</p>
