    <h4>Welcome To Scholars Bio</h4> 
    <p>Here, we provide basic information about some of our predeccesors who are scholars till our time due to the immense effort they put in for us and the generations to come to learn and practise pristine Islam and stay far away from all matters of innovations in our religion.</p><br>
    <P>It is important for every Muslim striving to seek the mercy of his/her Creator to learn and practise Islam in accordance to the way of the prophet and the pious predeccesors in order for the acts and utterances with the right intention, to be acceptable in the sight of Allah.</P><br>
    <p>May Allah continue to shower our prophet and our pious predeccesors with abundant blessings while making us steadfast on the path they left and accept our strivings and bless us too (Amin).</p>
